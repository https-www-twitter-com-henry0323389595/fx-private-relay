# Firefox Relay Interaction Data

Firefox Relay records information about Relay users and how they use the service. This
document describes the recorded information and what we do with the information we
collect.

We collect information to **provide the service** and to **answer questions about
service usage**.

For example, to **provide the service** we store information such as:

- The Relay email masks and phone masks created by the Relay user. This is needed
  to associate a mask with the Relay user.
- The Relay user's Mozilla account, including their account email and their
  subscription level. This is needed to forward emails from their Relay mask to their
  true email address, and to enable premium features.

One part of providing the service is to **catch bugs**. When something unexpected
happens, we capture the data needed to understand what happened. We avoid capturing
data that identifies the user. When necessary to fix the bug, we will include a
user identifier, like a database row number, that is only significant to the Relay team.

Other information is used to **answer questions about Relay usage**:

- Demographic:
  - From which country does the majority of our traffic originate?
  - Which browsers are most commonly used to access the Firefox Relay website?
  - Which devices are most commonly used to access the Firefox Relay website?
  - Which browser is running the Firefox Relay the add-on?
- User Behavior:
  - Do users delete aliases?
  - Do users create aliases?
  - How do users create aliases? From the Relay website dashboard? The context menu? The
    input icon?
  - Do users change the forwarding settings for their aliases?
  - Do users choose to install the Relay Extension?
  - Do users interact with the Relay extension panel?
  - When do users decide to upgrade to Premium?
  - How many email masks are created? What is the distribution of daily
    mask creation across users? Are there outliers who create many masks?
  - How many emails are forwarded? What is the distribution of daily email
    forwarding by count and email size? Are there outliers who forward many
    emails or very large emails?

# Metrics Collection and Data Storage

The Firefox Relay service is split into an API for interactive use, and a mask
processing service to handle email and phone masks.

API <--> DB[(Database)]

```

For information about data collected by Firefox, see the [Firefox Privacy Notice][].

Relay uses several methods to collect and store information:

- **Google Analytics** (third-party) - In the Relay website and extension, to measure
  usage.
- **Stripe** (third-party) - In the Relay website, to detect fraud.
- **Cookies** - In the Relay website and the API, to measure usage and provide
  the service.
- **The Relay Database** - In the API and mask processing, to provide the service,
  to enable features for some users, and to measure usage.
- **Statd-style statistics** - In the API and mask processing, to measure usage.
- **Server Logs** - In the API and mask processing, to provide the service,
  capture bugs, and measure usage.
- **Sentry** - In the API and mask processing, to capture bugs.
- **Glean metrics** - In the API and mask processing, to measure usage.

## Opt Out of Metrics Collection and Data Storage

There are a few ways to opt out of metrics and data storage.

A Relay user can **turn off data collection** on their [Mozilla account settings][].
Under "Data Collection and Use", turn off "Help improve Mozilla accounts". When this
setting is off:

- Google Analytics is not loaded on the Relay website
- Glean metrics are disabled on the Relay website, the Relay extension, and mask
  processing.
- The user's identifiers are omitted from server logs and enhanced bug captures.

A website visitor can **turn on the DNT header** (see
[How do I turn on the Do Not Track feature?][]). When a DNT header is enabled,
Google Analytics is not loaded on the Relay website, and collects no data for that
session.

A Relay user can **disable account names for email masks** on their [Relay settings][].
This will clear labels and associated websites for email masks in the Relay database.
This will disable features that suggest an email mask previously used on a website.

A Relay user with the phone subscription can **disable caller and text logs** on
their [Relay settings][]. This will disable the ability to respond to text messages.

# Google Analytics

[Google Analytics][] is a web analytics service that tracks and reports website traffic
and events. Relay uses it on the Relay website to track traffic and events, and in the
Relay extension to track usage. Relay user identifiers are not included in Google
Analytics traffic.

Website visitors can disable Google Analytics by turning on the DNT header in
their browser. A Relay user can disable Google Analytics by turning off data collection in
their Mozilla account. See [Opt Out of Metrics Collection and Data Storage][] for more
information. Google Analytics can also be disabled by many popular privacy and security
extensions.

Relay uses Universal Analytics, the third version of Google Analytics. Google has
[replaced Universal Analytics with Google Analytics 4][] (GA4). Relay is in the process
of switching to [GA4][].

## Website Event Collection

The website uses the GA4 [Measurement Protocol][], but is still using the
data structure of the [Universal Measurement Protocol][]. This will change as we adapt to
[changes in GA4 data model][].

A Google Analytics metric is called a "hit". The two main hit types are a page
view (`view`) and an event (`event`). Google Analytics takes care of the page
view hits, while the Relay website sends events. Each event has a category and
action, and may have a label, a value, and other data.

A common pair of events is an action "View" that is sent when a link or button is
visible to the user, and an action "Engage" that is sent when that link or button is
clicked. This allows measuring the percentage of users that click a link, and the
effectiveness of different text and presentations.

Here is a summary of the event categories and actions:

| Category                               | Action                  | Label                                                 | Context                                      |

paired with a [Holiday Sale Banner](#ctx-landing-banner-holiday) on the landing page.
This no longer appears after December 31, 2023. This news item emits the Google Analytics

screens, the button is a [hamburger menu button][] (similar to ☰) and includes links to
other Relay pages. In both cases, this menu has the "Sign Out" link for users.

### Onboarding

Onboarding is the process for introducing a user to Relay and getting their account
setup. The user should have a sense of where they are in the process, how much remains,
and be able to skip the process.

#### <a name="ctx-onboarding-free">Free Onboarding</a>

When a user signs up for the free Relay account, they go through the Free Onboarding
process. They see where they are in the process through a progress indicator at the
bottom of the screen.

On step 1, we explain email masks and prompt the user to generate their first mask:

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-free-step1.png"
      width=543
      alt="Step 1 of free onboarding. The user it prompted to Generate new mask."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-free-step1.png)

On step 2, we show the new mask and show how forwarding works:

      width=567
      alt="Step 2, part A of free onboarding. The user sees the new mask and is prompted to See how forwarding works."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-free-step2a.png)

We ask the user to paste their first email mask address and send a test email:

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-free-step2b.png"
      width=567
      alt="Step 2, part B of free onboarding. The user is prompted to paste the mask."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-free-step2b.png)

      width=574
      alt="Step 2, part C of free onboarding. The user is prompted to check their inbox."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-free-step2c.png)

#### <a name="ctx-onboarding-premium">Premium Onboarding</a>

When a user signs up for or upgrades to the Relay Premium service, they go through the
Premium Onboarding process. They see where they are in the process through a progress
indicator at the bottom of the screen.

On step 1, we list the benefits of Relay Premium:

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step1.png"
      width=636
      alt="Step 1 of premium onboarding. A list of benefits is shown. The user is prompted to 'Set up Relay Premium'."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step1.png)

On step 2, we prompt the user to setup a custom subdomain:

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step2a.png"
      width=609
      alt="Step 2, part A of premium onboarding. The user is prompted to enter a custom subdomain."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step2a.png)

If the subdomain is available, the user can register it.

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step2b.png"
      width=386
      alt="Step 2, part B of premium onboarding. The user is prompted to confirm the custom subdomain."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step2b.png)

We then confirm the user has reserved their custom subdomain.

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step2c.png"
      width=487
      alt="Step 2, part C of premium onboarding. The user is prompted to Continue."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step2c.png)

On step 3, we introduce the Relay extension and prompt the user to install it:

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step3a.png"
      width=590
      alt="Step 3, without extension. The user is prompted to install the Relay extension."
/>](./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step3a.png)

When the extension is installed, the user can exit onboarding and go to the dashboard.

[<img src="./docs/img/onboarding-premium-step3b.png"
      width=590
      alt="Step 3, with extension. The user is prompted to Go to Dashboard."

phone mask.

### Surveys

Occasionally we run surveys on the Relay website. These surveys often appear above the
[Navigation Bar][]. We use Google Analytics events to track some aspects of the surveys.

#### <a name="ctx-surveys-csat">Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Survey</a>

The [Customer Satisfaction][] survey is shown for free users after they have used the
site for 7, 30, and 90 days, and for subscribers after they have been subscribed for 7,
30, and 90 days. It is shown above the navigation bar. When a user picks a satisfaction
level, they are asked to take a two-minute survey on a third-party website. The
information collected in this survey is not covered by this document, but is processed
in accordance with [Mozilla's Privacy Policy][].

[<img src="./docs/img/survey-csat.png"
      width=647
      alt='The CSAT survey, asking "How satisfied are you with your Firefox Relay experience?"'

when we are actively recruiting for user research. The information collected in this
survey is not covered by this document, but is processed in accordance with
[Mozilla's Privacy Policy][].

### <a name="ctx-server">Server Events</a>

A Relay user requires a Mozilla account to use the service. This can be an existing
account or a new account created for using Relay. The Relay API server handles the
details of signing up and logging in with a Mozilla account. It sets a cookie,
`server_ga_event`, to communicate if the logged-in user has a newly created Relay
profile, or logged into an existing Profile.

The Google Analytics events:

- The user returns to the Relay website after creating a Relay profile.
  - `eventCategory`: `server event`
  - `eventAction`: `fired`
  - `eventLabel`: `user_signed_up`
- The user returns to the Relay website after logging into an existing Relay profile.
  - `eventCategory`: `server event`
  - `eventAction`: `fired`
  - `eventLabel`: `user_logged_in`

### Legacy Website Tracking

There are components in the Relay Website code base that are not currently used on the
site. They are documented here for completeness.

#### <a name="ctx-legacy-purchase-premium">Purchased Premium</a>

When there was a single paid subscription plan, purchase tracking assumed a single plan.
This was first tracked in the API backend, but later moved to the Relay Website. In
September 2022, Relay added phone mask plans, and we expanded subscription tracking to
include the plan. See [Plan Matrix](#ctx-landing-matrix) for purchase tracking after
September 2022.

The Google Analytics events:

- The user purchases a premium Relay plan
  - `eventCategory`: `server event`
  - `eventAction`: `fired`
  - `eventLabel`: `user_purchased_premium`

#### <a name="ctx-legacy-survey-nps">Net Promoter Score Survey</a>

Starting February 2021, Relay ran a [Net Promoter Score][] survey at the top of the site.
This was replaced in June 2022 by the [Customer Satisfaction Survey](#ctx-surveys-csat)

[Net Promoter Score]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score

The Google Analytics events:

- The user answers the question "On a scale from 1-10, how likely are you to recommend Relay Premium to a friend or colleague?"
  - `eventCategory`: `NPS Survey`
  - `eventAction`: `submitted`

    - `detractor` _(6 or less)_

  - `eventValue`: _one of_:
    - -1 _(detractor)_
    - 0 _(passive)_
    - 1 _(promoter)_
  - `metric1`: 1
  - `metric2`: -1, 0, _or_ 1
  - `metric3`: 1 _to_ 10 _(Not likely to Very likely)_
